### üî¨ Projects & Research

Here are some of the key projects that showcase my skills and experience.

**1. Design and Implementation of a Control System for a Two-Wheeled Balancing Vehicle Based on Multi-Sensor Fusion**
   - **Description:** This was my undergraduate capstone project where I designed and built a robust control system to stabilize a two-wheeled vehicle. The project involved fusing data from an IMU (gyroscope and accelerometer) to achieve stable balancing.
   - **Technologies Used:** C, Keil, Sensor Fusion Algorithms, PID Control.
